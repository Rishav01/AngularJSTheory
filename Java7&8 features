Java 7 Feature
1.	String in Switch statements
2.	Binary Literals – Can express any literals (int, long, short, byte) using binary code with a prefix 0b/0B.
3.	Underscore in Literals – For better readability and grouping the digits in java.
4.	Diamond Operator – This is for DRY coding. Removes the effort for repeating type. 
5.	Multi-Catch Exception – Shorten the traditional coding practice. Writes from specific to generic exception.
6.	Try-With-Resource – Resource should get closed after the cursor reaches to the last line. Closable resource should be kept as parameter for try block. 

Java 8 Feature
1.	ForEach() - Consumer and game class. We need to make a annonymous class by overriding the accept method. 
Example: 
import java.util.*;
import java.util.function.Consumer;
public class MyClass {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Set<Integer> s = new HashSet<Integer>();
        s.add(1);
        s.add(2);
        s.forEach(new Consumer<Integer>(){
           @Override
           public void accept(Integer i){
               System.out.println(i);
           }
        });
    }
}
Note: all you need to care about is the type of th data need for the collection and iteration.
